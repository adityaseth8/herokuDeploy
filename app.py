            Businesses often rely on accurate sales forecasts to make better business
            decisions, including efficient resource allocation and cash flow management. Using data 
            analytics, businesses can also identify potential weaknesses in their business models, 
            such as underperforming products, geographical locations, etc. Our product is targeted
            towards small businesses, who lack the capital to pour significant amounts of money 
            into data analytics.\n
            Profitify by DDSC is a web application, aimed at increasing revenue and profit for supermarkets 
            through a sales forecasting model. Owners have access to a data dashboard, which visually

            products, time analysis, demographics, and more.
